var myString: string;
// I can assign myString like this:
myString = "Bee stinger";
// Why is there a problem with this? What can I do to fix this?
myString = '9';
i put the number in a string

function sayHello(name: string){
   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
// This is working great:
console.log(sayHello("Kermit"));
// Why isn't this working? I want it to return "Hello, 9!"
console.log('hello, 9!';
I put 'hello, 9' into a string instead of being seperated by ()

function fullName(firstName: string, lastName: string, middleName: string){
   let fullName = `${firstName} ${middleName} ${lastName}`;
   return fullName;
}
// This works:
console.log(fullName("Mary", "Moore", "Tyler"));
// What do I do if someone doesn't have a middle name?
console.log(fullName("Jimbo", "Jones", ""));

I added an empty string to the argument so it still had three arguments just not a middlename

interface Student {
   firstName: string;
   lastName: string;
   belts: number;
}
function graduate(ninja: Student){
   return `Congratulations, ${ninja.firstName} ${ninja.lastName}, you earned ${ninja.belts} belts!`;
}
const christine = {
   firstName: "Christine",
   lastName: "Yang",
   belts: 2
}
const jay = {
   firstName: "Jay",
   lastName: "Patel",
   belts: 4
}
// This seems to work fine:
console.log(graduate(christine));
// This one has problems:
console.log(graduate(jay));

I added an s to belts under jake

class Ninja {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    fullName: string;

    constructor(firstName, lastName, fullName) {
      ;
   
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    } 
      
   debug(){
      console.log("Console.log() is my friend.")
   }
}
// This is not making an instance of Ninja, for some reason:
let shane = new Ninja("shane", "sexton", "Shane Sexton");
console.log(shane.debug)

// Since I'm having trouble making an instance of Ninja, I decided to do this:
const turing = new Ninja("Allen", "turing", "allen turing")
    // Now I'll make a study function, which is a lot like our graduate function from above:
function study(programmer: Ninja){
   return `Ready to whiteboard an algorithm, ${programmer.fullName}?`
}
// Now this has problems:
console.log(study(turing));

I'm not really sure if this was what i was suppose to do or not but i didn't really knwo what else to do
